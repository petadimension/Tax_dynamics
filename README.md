# Tax_dynamics stochastic simulations and agent-based models
Stochastic simulation of Tax dynamics is implemented by TaxSSAsinglesim.cpp. Compilation requires c++0x:

g++ TaxSSAsinglesim.cpp -std=c++0x -o singlesim.out

R-wrapper files for implementation of stochastic simulations and plot of results are given.

R-script files for agent-based models are located in the directory ABM/
